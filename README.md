a (not-working) idea for an API for wrapping Aran advice and pointcuts. the wrapped advice and pointcut would allow you to easily store a complete state-transition-state-transition-... history of your cesk machine with reference to the original and instrumented nodes.

this would be helpful for students learning to trace code. you can use the cesk machine history to render traces of different aspects of a student's script on demand. a student could select which aspects they want to see traced and the output could be updated dynamically by filtering which transitions and states to render.
